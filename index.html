  <h1>Neovim Cheatsheet by falasi</h1>
  <p>As I learn web development using Neovim as my IDE of choice, I’m documenting everything in a cheatsheet that I’m building manually in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and later in React as I progress through <a href="https://theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>.</p>
  <p>I want to thank the entire open source community for sharing such incredible tools and knowledge. There’s nothing else like it. I’ve never seen anything comparable in the real world.</p>
  <p>I’ve decided to finally learn development because it builds directly on my existing experience working in cybersecurity and fills in the pieces I’ve always wanted to understand at a deeper level.</p>
