#  Neovim Cheatsheet by falasi

As I learn web development using Neovim as my IDE of choice, I’m documenting everything in a cheatsheet that I’m building manually in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and later in React as I progress through The Odin Project.

I want to thank the entire open source community for sharing such incredible tools and knowledge. There’s nothing else like it. I’ve never seen anything comparable in the real world.

I’ve decided to finally learn development because it builds directly on my existing experience working in cybersecurity and fills in the pieces I’ve always wanted to understand at a deeper level.
